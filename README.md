### Description

This project utilized intermediate and advanced HTML/CSS in order to build a responsive design, from scratch, suitable for desktop and iPhone configurations. JavaScript was introduced in order to create a responsive modal box in which the user can edit their profile picture, name and bio, add a card, as well as view, like and delete images. Additionally, JavaScript was used to provide a user-end validation system for the information input into the forms and the modal boxes can be closed using multiple techniques. Refactoring the project utilizing classes and fetching data from API's helped to organize code, make it reusable among various elements, and prepared the project to be launched over Webpack and then on Git Pages through a real server.
