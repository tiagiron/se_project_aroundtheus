### Description

This project utilized intermediate and advanced HTML/CSS in order to build a responsive design, from scratch, suitable for desktop and iPhone configurations. JavaScript was introduced in order to create a responsive modal box in which the user can edit their profile name and bio. JavaScript was also used to refactor the cards and display them from an array rather than as explicit HTML. Additionally, JavaScript was used to provide a user-end validation system for the information input into the forms and the modal boxes can be closed using multiple techniques.
